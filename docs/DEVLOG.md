# Development log

One entry per working day. What Claude Code did, which model did what, and what needed a human decision. This log is the source for the "how we used Claude" section of the README and the submission form.

## 2026-11-02 (Mon), kickoff day, evening session

**Model:** `claude-fable-5-1` in Claude Code, planning role.

**Done**
- Read the pre-event planning notes (kept outside the repo) and reviewed them critically: scope versus time, logical holes, judge questions.
- Created this private repository after the 12:00 JST kickoff and committed the `create-next-app` scaffold (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind 4, pnpm).
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PLAN.md` (scope, architecture decisions, day-by-day task board), `docs/PRIVACY.md` (retention table), `.env.example`.
- Wrote the initial database migration (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`) and seed drafts for the 武蔵小杉 board.
- Wrote the Claude prompts (`lib/claude/prompts/`) and JSON schemas (`lib/claude/schemas/`) for extract, translate, reconcile and ask.

**Decisions made today (human)**
- Product name: Engawa (縁側).
- Hosting: Cloudflare Workers was the first choice, revised the same evening to Vercel Hobby. The Workers free plan allows 10 ms of CPU per request, too tight for server rendering, and there is no budget for the paid plan. Vercel Hobby covers 300 second functions and a daily cron for free.
- No alert or early-warning features. The board starts where alerts stop.
- Pilot board: 武蔵小杉 (中原区, 川崎市).
- Reconcile is a single structured call over code-selected candidates, not an agent loop.
- Minimal admin page and the purge job are in the must list; pink masking of screenshots is a time-boxed experiment at the end.
- Area badge is "self-reported area", never "verified".
- Implementation from tomorrow runs on `claude-opus-5-5`; Fable returns for prompt tuning and the 11/6 review.

**Also done**
- Verified the shelters for the board against the city's designated shelter list (資料編 2-06, as of 2025-04-01) and the emergency water points (2-18), read from the city's PDFs. 小杉小学校 (opened 2019) is the designated shelter for 小杉町2丁目 and 3丁目 and becomes the demo shelter. Seed updated with addresses and target areas.

**Open for the human**
- Supabase project and keys, Anthropic API key, Vercel project from the GitHub repo.
- Fixture inputs with fake names and avatars.

## 2026-11-03 (Tue, holiday), implementation day 1

**Model:** `claude-fable-5-1` in Claude Code, implementation role. The plan said implementation would run on `claude-opus-5-5`; the session the human started for this day ran on Fable 5.1, so that is what is recorded here. Extraction itself runs on `claude-opus-5-5` (measured below). The session started late on the evening of 11/02 JST and ran into 11/03.

**Done**
- `next.config.ts`: `cacheComponents: false`. Scripts: `typecheck` (`next typegen && tsc --noEmit`), `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `eval`, `purge`, `latency`.
- `lib/i18n`: five message files with 86 keys each (parity checked by script, no dashes), `t()` with `{placeholders}`, count variants, a `LanguageSwitch` and a `TextSizeToggle`. The first server render picks the language from a cookie, else from `Accept-Language` (the server side of `navigator.language`); the client writes the cookie and a localStorage mirror on change, so server and client agree and there is no flash of the wrong language.
- `/b/[slug]`: server-rendered board, card list with category icon, place in the reader's language plus the Japanese name, "N minutes ago", source type, source count and an "may be outdated" badge; a non-modal detail sheet (no focus trap, Escape closes) with all six languages and the stripped original; polling every 5 seconds with a visibility check. Index page lists boards. When `SUPABASE_URL` is empty the board renders from the seed JSON, read only.
- Supabase: `0001_init.sql` applied. The CLI was not logged in and the direct database host is IPv6 only, so `scripts/migrate.ts` builds the connection string from `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PASSWORD` and runs `supabase db push --db-url` through the Tokyo session pooler. `pnpm db:migrate` is now reproducible without a browser login. The bucket is created by the migration.
- Drop-in: one button, panel with camera, image and text, one-time purpose notice. Browser re-encodes to JPEG (long edge 1568px, EXIF gone). Upload goes to `POST /api/b/[slug]/submissions` as multipart, where a pure JS stripper removes JPEG APPn and COM segments (JFIF, ICC and Adobe kept) and PNG text, EXIF and time chunks before the image is stored with the service role. Tested on crafted files with planted EXIF, comments, text chunks and a post-EOI trailer. Decision: no signed upload URLs after all, so the browser never holds a Supabase key and no unstripped image ever reaches storage. Rate limits (3 per device, 30 per board per minute) and the 120 second watchdog are in.
- `POST /api/process/[id]` streams `stage`, `done` and `failed` as server-sent events while the uploader stays connected (`maxDuration = 300`). It claims the submission with a compare-and-set update, so a retry cannot run twice. Cards get `purge_after = valid_until + 30 days`, submissions get the latest card's `purge_after`, raw text is cleared, chat screenshot originals are deleted right after processing (detected platform not `paper`).
- `lib/claude/extract.ts`: `claude-opus-5-5`, `messages.stream()` with `output_config.format` set to the JSON schema file and `effort: low`, system prompt and board context as two cached blocks, the current JST time and the input in the user turn. Code validates enums and the six languages, nulls any `place_id` not on the board, and rejects the whole result if a phone number or email survives in any text field. The daily cap check and `bump_usage` wrap every call.
- `vercel.json` with the daily cron at 18:00 UTC (03:00 JST), `/api/cron/purge` guarded by `CRON_SECRET`, `lib/db/purge.ts` deletes storage objects first, then rows.
- `scripts/seed.ts` generates the admin token once and stores only its sha256; `--token-file` writes it to a git-ignored file so it never appears in a terminal or a chat.
- Seven text fixtures and one synthetic notice image written (fictional names, handles, a room number and a phone number planted on purpose).

**Extract latency (one structured call, six languages, `claude-opus-5-5`, effort low, text inputs, measured from this Mac)**

| fixture | ms | input | cache read | cache write | output | facts | place_id |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| t02 water notice (ja) | 14239 | 133 | 0 | 6607 | 1003 | 1 | kosugi-es |
| t03 WeChat konbini (zh) | 10152 | 156 | 6607 | 0 | 835 | 1 | musashikosugi-sta |
| p05 Facebook water (vi) | 10660 | 254 | 6607 | 0 | 1076 | 1 | kosugi-es |
| p06 aftershock rumour (ja) | 11623 | 135 | 6607 | 0 | 1062 | 1 | musashikosugi-sta, flagged `rumor` |
| p08 queue is short (en) | 7580 | 98 | 6607 | 0 | 770 | 1 | kosugi-es |

Median 10.7 s, mean 10.9 s, min 7.6 s, max 14.2 s. The prompt cache hits from the second call on (system prompt plus board context, 6607 tokens). Every planted name, handle, phone number and room number was absent from every output field; the WeChat line offering diapers from a room number was discarded as `personal_only`, which is the intended behaviour. The rumour was flagged and would be held.

Vision path, same call shape, the synthetic notice image `s02` (800 by 600 JPEG, 683 input tokens): `claude-opus-5-5` 9662 ms, 1 fact, `kosugi-es`, 14:00 to 16:00 on 11/03 as ISO with the +09:00 offset, source type `official`, confidence `high`.

Comparison run on the same six inputs with `claude-sonnet-5-5`, effort low:

| fixture | Opus ms | Sonnet ms | Sonnet result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| t02 water notice (ja) | 14239 | 7527 | same card, `kosugi-es` |
| t03 WeChat konbini (zh) | 10152 | 7430 | same, `musashikosugi-sta` |
| p05 Facebook water (vi) | 10660 | 6164 | same, `kosugi-es`, phone number removed |
| p06 aftershock rumour (ja) | 11623 | 8080 | flagged `rumor`, `place_id` null where Opus chose `musashikosugi-sta` |
| p08 queue is short (en) | 7580 | 6788 | same, `kosugi-es` |
| s02 notice image | 9662 | 8232 | same, `kosugi-es` |

Sonnet median 7.5 s (mean 7.4 s), Opus median 10.7 s (mean 10.9 s). Both passed the planted PII check on every field.

**Decision:** one call, on `claude-opus-5-5`. Both models are well under the 20 second threshold in the plan, so extract is not split into extract plus translate and `translate.ts` stays unwritten. Opus stays the default because the eval on 11/05 decides quality, not three seconds of latency, and the placeholder card already covers the wait. `EXTRACT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5-5` switches the pipeline in one environment variable if the deployed latency or the budget say otherwise. If photographed fixtures turn out slower, the threshold and the split path are unchanged.

**Second half: seed and end to end test** (`claude-opus-5-5` in Claude Code; the human switched the session model with `/model` after the secret key arrived)
- The human replaced the publishable key in `.env.local` with the secret key. `pnpm db:seed --token-file .env.admin-token.local` created the board and the 2 sample cards; the admin token is only in that git-ignored file (mode 600).
- The deployed board at `/b/musashikosugi` returned 404 before the seed because the board row did not exist yet (`getBoardBySlug` returned null, so the page called `notFound()`). After the seed it returns 200 and reads the same database.
- Drop-in tested on `pnpm dev` through the real UI in the browser: purpose notice on first use, then the fixture file set on the file input, so browser compression, upload, server strip, SSE and polling all ran. Times are from the file pick to the finished card, measured in the page.

| input | path | stages seen | time to card | result |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `p02-water-distribution-notice.jpg` | photo | received, preparing image, reading, checking, done | 18.7 s (extract about 15 s) | public card, `water`, `kosugi-es`, 14:00 to 16:00, `official`, all six languages; the 訓練用 stamp is reported in the text, not hidden |
| `p04-line-water-same-fact.png` | chat screenshot | same | 14.1 s | public card, `water`, `kosugi-es`, `secondhand`, platform `line` |
| `p06-rumour-aftershock.txt` | pasted text | received, reading, checking, held | 12.5 s | card stored with `visibility = held`, flag `rumor`; uploader sees "not public yet, it needs checking first"; the public cards API does not return it |

- PII: none of the 14 planted strings from `fixtures/expected/p04.json` (four names in kanji and kana, the handle すずき and the phone number) appear anywhere in the p04 card row, including `original_text`. The excerpt keeps only the three messages about water.
- Deletion: the p04 original was removed from Storage 0.5 s after processing (`image_deleted_at` set, object gone from the bucket listing). The p02 paper photo stays, as designed, with `purge_after` 30 days after the card expires. Raw text is cleared on every submission.
- The stored p02 photo was 298 KB in, 169 KB after browser re-encoding, and contains only JFIF and ICC segments, no EXIF.
- Both water cards show "may be outdated" when tested at 23:07 JST. That is correct: the notice says 本日 14:00 to 16:00, which the prompt resolves to today, and 16:00 has passed. The demo must be recorded with a notice dated for the recording time, or during the stated hours.
- Expected gap: p04 created a second water card instead of merging into the p02 card, because reconcile is day 2 work. `fixtures/expected/p04.json` already lists the merge as required.
- Deployed pipeline: the p08 text fixture sent to `https://engawa-pearl.vercel.app` through the same two routes produced a public card. Claude took 7.8 s; the whole request took 18.8 s from this Mac. So the prompt and schema files are bundled correctly on Vercel. The functions run in `iad1` (Washington) while Supabase is in Tokyo, and one drop-in makes about a dozen database calls, which explains most of the gap.
- Fixed: text submissions no longer show "preparing the image"; the process route starts them at the reading stage.

**Needed a human (open at the end of the session)**
- Review day 1 on localhost and on the deployed URL (checklist in the hand-over message).
- Decide whether to pin Vercel functions to Tokyo: `"regions": ["hnd1"]` in `vercel.json` (Hobby allows one region). Expected effect: the dozen database calls per drop-in and every board render stay in Tokyo; the single Claude call crosses the Pacific instead. Not changed in this session so the deployment under review stays as it is.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` on Vercel (being added). Nothing in day 1 code reads it yet; share links on day 3 will.
- Acceptance with a real phone photo on the deployed URL is still the human's step.
